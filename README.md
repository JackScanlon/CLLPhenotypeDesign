## Workflows
Concept creation has been integrated into the phenotype workflow, and the Concept's codelist is created through a treeview by use of a include/exclude tool.

## To run this on a local machine:

3. Open a terminal in the cloned repo or cd to the folder
4. Run the following command to install the project dependencies:
